There are 2 simple rules you need to follow when creating new entries.

## Style
Follow the style of `[<Project name>](<URL>), "<Amended, quirky quote by the project itself>" - <Short, quirky description/example of wrongdoing>.`

An example of this would be:\
`[list-of-shame](https://github.com/KennyTV/list-of-shame/), "The List Of Shame, made by drama hungry people on the internet" - Only there to stirr up drama, created by some upsidedown guy.`\
-> [list-of-shame](https://github.com/KennyTV/list-of-shame/), "The List Of Shame, made by drama hungry people on the internet" - Only there to stirr up drama, created by some upsidedown guy.

## Be sane
Don't use plain insults or very strong/discriminating language.
Don't include unfounded statements.
